We made a BMI bash script where we get the user Body Mass Index by their height,weight,age, and gender.

NOTE!!! 

You need to install the " bc " pacage in order for you to run the bash script without any issues!

Below I have wrote the command for the distro


Distribution	Command
OS X	brew install bc
Debian	apt-get install bc
Ubuntu	apt-get install bc
Alpine	apk add bc
Arch Linux	pacman -S bc
Kali Linux	apt-get install bc
CentOS	yum install bc
Fedora	dnf install bc
Raspbian	apt-get install bc


Also, I have attached a screenshot of how you can get the output in whatever color you like.


Thank you for your understanding :D
